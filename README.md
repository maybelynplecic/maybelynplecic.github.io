# Welcome to Maybelyn's curiosities!

It's not enough to learn or read. We must apply the lessons and make them relevant to our current needs.

I believe in putting more effort into leaving a mark or making each interaction better and kinder than before.

We can't keep knowledge to ourselves. It needs to be shared so that most, if not all, of us benefit from them. 

**P.S.** I'm starting my page as part of always learning and progressing iteratively.
