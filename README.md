# Welcome to Maybelyn's curiosities!

Learning or reading alone is not enough. We must apply the lessons and make them relevant to our current needs.

I believe in putting more effort into leaving a mark or making each interaction better and kinder than before.

We can't keep knowledge to ourselves. It needs to be shared so that most, if not all, of us benefit from them. 

The next step is to build out my project repositories.

**P.S.** I'm starting my page as part of always learning and progressing iteratively.
